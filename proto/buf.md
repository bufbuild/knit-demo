# Knit Demo Service: Star Wars API

This module contains example RPC services built with [Connect][connect]
to demonstrate how to use [Knit][knit] and its capabilities.

The services expose the data that is available from the [Star Wars API][swapi].
They include endpoints for querying collections of objects that represent
elements from the [_Star Wars_ franchise of films][films].

For more on Knit, see the various repos, which contain documentation in
their READMEs:
* [github.com/bufbuild/knit][knit] - Overview of Knit / The Knit Protocol
* [github.com/bufbuild/knit-web][knit-web] - The Knit Client (TypeScript)
* [github.com/bufbuild/knit-go][knit-go] - The Knit Gateway Server (Go)
